### 12.2 Pivot Scenarios

**Scenario A: Low Customer Adoption (<30,000 downloads by Month 6)**
- **Diagnosis:** Marketing failure or product-market fit issue
- **Pivot:**
  - Focus entirely on Vietnamese diaspora (niche-first strategy)
  - Introduce referral-only access (create exclusivity)

  - Simplify app: Remove AR, focus on core ordering + loyalty

**Scenario B: High Development Costs Overrun (>30% over budget)**
- **Diagnosis:** Technical complexity underestimated
- **Pivot:**
  - Cut features: AR, advanced analytics (phase 2 launch)
  - Outsource: Contract agency for mobile dev (lower cost)
  - Extend timeline: 10 months instead of 7 (reduce burn rate)

**Scenario C: Franchisee Resistance**
- **Diagnosis:** Change management failure
- **Pivot:**
  - Pilot extension: 6 months instead of 3 months (prove ROI)

3. **Loyalty Points:** Honor outstanding points (convert to vouchers valid for 6 months)
4. **Franchisee Transition:** Revert to manual POS ordering, provide offline menu management tools
5. **IP Salvage:** Open-source parts of codebase (AR customizer, loyalty engine) for developer community
6. **Team:** Offer employees transition to other Kopi Saigon roles or provide severance
